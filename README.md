# Procedure
1) Clone this repo.


2) Open this folder as work-space in VS Code. (`code .` in terminal)


3) Make necessary changes to main.cc. This acts as your default main file for all problems of a particular contest.


4) use ``` ctrl+shift+` ``` to open a new terminal when in vs code. Here type in `./parse.py (contest_name)` (eg.`./parse.py 4`) to download all the test-cases (input and output) of that particular contest.


5) Navigate to A.cc using the keybindings `ctrl+p` and type in A.cc


6) Open Output.txt by using the keybindings `ctrl+p` and type Output.txt


7) To build and test-run with given test-cases, use `ctrl+shift+b` and select C++ builder.
